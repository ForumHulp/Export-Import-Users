Export Import users
=========

This Extension is able to export or import users. Found user_id's will be updated with the data in the xml file. 

Not found user_id's are inserted and become a registered user in your forum. The xml user file is automatically deleted after insert or save.
Fields that are saved are username, user_password, user_email, user_from, user_website and user_occ.
Be carefull with this extension as it will overwrite your account if it's in the xml file.
